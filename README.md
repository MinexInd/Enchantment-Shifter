**Enchantment Shifter**
Hey, Minecraft adventurers! Enchantment Shifter is a lightweight mod for Fabric that lets you play around with enchantments in a whole new way. Ever wanted to pull those sweet enchantments off your old sword and stash them in a book? Or maybe shift them onto a shiny new axe? With this mod, you can—using just the good ol’ anvil and a bit of XP.

**Why You’ll Love This Mod**
Fair and Square: The XP cost feels right—it’s based on vanilla anvil math, so it’s balanced but tweakable.
Make It Your Own: Want cheaper transfers? A flat XP rate? Or maybe a cap on how many enchantments move at once? Dive into the config file and set it up your way!
Vanilla Vibes: No new items, blocks, or ores—just pure enchantment-shifting goodness that fits right into Minecraft.
Up to Date: Built for Minecraft 1.20.1 on Fabric, ready for your latest adventures.
Modpack Ready: Toss this into any modpack you like—just give a shoutout in the comments below!
**What It Does**
Pop an enchanted item and a target (a book or another item) into the anvil, and watch the magic happen:

Item to Book: Strip enchantments off gear and turn a plain book into an enchanted one.
Item to Item: Move enchantments straight to another item (as long as they fit—like no Silk Touch on a sword).
Custom Rules: Decide the XP cost, limit how many enchantments shift, or choose if you get the stripped item back—all in the config.
