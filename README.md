# Enchantment Shifter
Hi there, Minecraft explorers! **Enchantment Shifter** is a small-scale mod for Fabric that allows you to experiment with enchantments in a completely different manner. Want to remove those lovely enchantments from that ancient sword and store them in a book? Or flip them to a new axe? With this mod, you can—using nothing more than the trusty old anvil and some XP.

## Why You’ll Love This Mod
- **Fair and Square**: The XP cost feels right—it’s based on vanilla anvil math, so it’s balanced but tweakable.
- **Make It Your Own**: Want cheaper transfers? A flat XP rate? Or maybe a cap on how many enchantments move at once? Dive into the config file and set it up your way!
- **Vanilla Vibes**: No new blocks, ores, or items—just plain old enchantment-switching goodness that slots right into Minecraft.
- **Up to Date**: Made for Minecraft Fabric Modloader, ready for your next adventure.
- **Modpack Ready**: Throw this into any modpack you desire—just give a shoutout in the comments below!

## What It Does
Pop an enchanted item and a target (a book or another item) into the anvil, and behold the magic:

- **Item to Book**: Remove enchantments from items and convert an unenchanted book into an enchanted book.
- **Item to Item**: Transfer enchantments directly to a different item (so long as they have space—such as no Silk Touch on a sword).
- **Custom Rules**: Set the XP cost, restrict the number of enchantments transfer, or set whether you receive the stripped item back—all of this in the config.
